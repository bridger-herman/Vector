#January 10-18, 2015#
+ Fixed parametric vector contstructor
+ Added support methods to parametric vector
+ Added some mathematical methods
+ Eliminated "mode" for Vec3D objects - nobody cares about ijk notation anyway
+ Clarified certain variable names
+ Removed formatting option for Vec3D magnitude
+ Fixed some tuple index issues from a previous version
+ Removed paramplot() from Axis3D and merged functionality into plot()
+ Made scale of ParVec3Ds to work correctly(ish)
+ Changed labels on axes

##In Progress##
+ Adding/Fixing Mathematical methods to parametric vector
+ Changing control of time parameters into ParVec3D instead of Axis3D

##Future##
+ Attempt to merge ParVec3D and Vec3D into one class, dependant on number of parameters
