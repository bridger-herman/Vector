Vector
=======
A project for 3 Dimensional vector oprerations and visualization, made in Python 3.
## Vector Operations ##
### Available operations include: ###
+ Cross (Vector) Product `u.cross(v)`
+ Dot (Scalar) Product `u.dot(v)`
+ Vector Addition `u + v`
+ Vector Subtraction `u - v`
+ Scalar Multiplication `u * k`
+ Scalar Division `u / k`
+ Projection `u.proj(v)`
+ Unit Vectors `u.unit()`
+ Angle Between Vectors `u.angle(v)`
#### Determine if two vectors are: ####
+ Parallel
+ Orthogonal
+ Distinct
## Vector Visualization (3D) ##
+ Creating the 3D axis
+ Setting the scale of said axis
+ Plotting points
+ Plotting vectors
