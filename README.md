Vector
=======
A project for 3 Dimensional vector operations and visualization, made in Python 3.

## Vectors ##

### Available operations include: ###
+ Cross (Vector) Product `u.cross(v)`
+ Dot (Scalar) Product `u.dot(v)`
+ Vector Addition `u + v`
+ Vector Subtraction `u - v`
+ Scalar Multiplication `u * k`
+ Scalar Division `u / k`
+ Projection `u.proj(v)`
+ Unit Vectors `u.unit()`
+ Angle Between Vectors `u.angle(v)`

#### Determine if two vectors are: ####
+ Parallel
+ Orthogonal
+ Distinct

## Parametric Vectors ##
+ Still heavily under construction, no methods work yet

## Points ##

### Available operations include: ###
+ Distance between points `p.distance(q)`

## Visualization (3D) ##
+ Create the 3D axes
+ Set minima and maxima of said axes
+ Plot points, vectors, and parametric vectors
